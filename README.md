# Cloud Resume Challenge - AWS

A cloud-native resume website built following the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/). This project showcases AWS serverless architecture, Infrastructure as Code, and modern web development practices.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project uses a serverless architecture with the following AWS services:
- **S3**: Static website hosting
- **CloudFront**: Content delivery network
- **API Gateway**: REST API endpoints
- **Lambda**: Serverless functions
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline

## üí° Implementation Choices

### Infrastructure as Code
This project uses AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure management because:
- **Native AWS Integration**: Deep integration with AWS services
- **Automatic Rollbacks**: Built-in rollback functionality on failure
- **Change Sets**: Preview changes before deployment
- **Stack Updates**: Managed updates with drift detection
- **AWS Support**: Direct support from AWS

### CI/CD Pipeline
The deployment pipeline uses GitHub Actions to:
1. Run automated tests
2. Deploy CloudFormation stack
3. Build and optimize website assets
4. Sync content to S3
5. Invalidate CloudFront cache

### Security Considerations
- CloudFront for HTTPS and edge security
- S3 bucket policies for public read-only access
- IAM roles with least privilege principle
- API Gateway with rate limiting
- DynamoDB with encryption at rest
